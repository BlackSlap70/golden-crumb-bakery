# Git Commit Template Demo

This is a test file to demonstrate the commit template system.

## How Method 2 Works:

When you run `git commit` (without `-m`), Git will open your default editor with a pre-filled template that includes:

- 🏷️ Commit type options with emojis
- 📝 Examples of good commit messages  
- 🎯 Formatting guidelines
- 💡 Tips for writing meaningful commits

The template helps ensure consistent, professional commit messages for your Golden Crumb Bakery project.

## Usage:
1. Make your changes
2. Run: `git add .`
3. Run: `git commit` (no -m flag)
4. Edit the template that appears
5. Save and close the editor

Your commit will be created with the message you wrote!
